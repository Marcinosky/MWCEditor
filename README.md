# MWCEditor

MWCeditor - a save editor by durkhaz 		updated by marcinowski
For the (cool) game "My Winter Car"			by Amistech Games 


**Q: What does it do?**

Its a fork of [MSCeditor](https://github.com/durkhaz/MSCEditor), updated to work with the new game


**Q: Does everything work?**

No, while the original editor works natively with MWC save files, some features are broken while others crash outright



**Q: So what is this?**

Im currently focused on refactoring the app to fit the new game and hiding all the broken features. 



**Q: Are you planning to fix them?**

I want to recreate all original functionality for the new game, first focus is player, time and weather management



**Q: Where do I find my saves?**

AppData\\LocalLow\\Amistech\\My Winter Car. The tool should open the correct folder on first launch though.
